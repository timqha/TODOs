React Native Task
 
“Please create a TODO List application, in React Native, which users can use to add, view and delete TODO items (called “TODOs”). Example TODOs in the list might be:
•        Wash the car
•        Mow the lawn
•        Do the washing-up
 
When starting the application, the list should be empty. There should be a form for adding new TODOs, somewhere to view all TODOs, and a way to tick off (i.e. remove) TODOs.
 
This project is intended to be a way for you to demonstrate your coding abilities, and your ability to create user interfaces. The code and the UI do not need to be complicated, and this should take under 3 hours. If you can, please use TypeScript.
